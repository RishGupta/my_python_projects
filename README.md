This repo will have any other personal projects I have undertaking to enhance my skills on the python language or any other Data Science/ Data Engineering tool for that matter

The projects include - 
  1. Web scraping using urllib and beautifulsoup libraries
  2. How to work with APIs, YAMl and JSON files in python and how to extract data and push it into a dataframe
  3. How to connect to various sources of data like Sybase, Snowflake, MySQL etc. databases
  4. General ETL pipelines using PySpark, Kafka, Spark Streaming, Redshift etc. over an AWS console and a cloud provider like Cloudera
  5. The repo will also contain some of the assignments I did as part of interview processes of various companies ( Please dont copy, you could use this as inspiration, but blatantly copying wont serve any purpose and will set you up for failure)
  6. General practice for EDA, python manipulation using pandas, numpy etc.
